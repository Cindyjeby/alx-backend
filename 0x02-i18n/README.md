<h1>i18n And l10n</h1>
<P>i18n stands for internationalization</P>
<P> Internationalization is the process of designing and preparing your application so that it can be adapted to different languages and regions without engineering changes.</P>
<p>l10n stands for localization</p>
<p>Localization is the process of adapting an internationalized application for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.</p>
<p>For this to be possible we use a flask extention called "Flask-Babel"</p>
<h2>Flask-Babel</h2>
<p>This is a flask extentionthat makes working with translations very easy</p>
<h3>To Install:</h3>
<p>pip install Flask-Babel</p>
