<h1>PAGINATION</h1>
<p>refers to the division of content, usually a list of items, into separate pages. It's commonly used in websites, applications, or documents to display a limited number of items per page, making it easier for users to navigate through the content. Pagination helps improve the user experience by breaking down large amounts of information into manageable chunks</p>
